# Extra Features

## Structure of the document

The structure of the LaTeX project (`\chapter`, `\section`, `\subsection`, ...) is accessible via the TeX panel on the left of the editor. The entry corresponding to the cursor position in the editor is automatically selected and follows the cursor. The outline hierarchy is defined by [`latex-workshop.view.outline.sections`](#latex-workshopviewoutlinesections).

Note that the Explorer panel also contains an outline view but it only shows the structure of the current file and does not take into account any included file.

### latex-workshop.view.outline.sections

The section names of LaTeX outline hierarchy. It is also used by the folding mechanism. See [Code folding](Environments#code-folding) for more details.

This property is an array of case-sensitive strings in the order of the document structure hierarchy. For multiple tags of the same level, separate the tags with `|` as delimiters, e.g., `section|alternative`.

|         type         |                           default value                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _array_ of _strings_ | `[ "part", "chapter", "section", "subsection", "subsubsection" ]` |

The structure of the document can be obtained

### latex-workshop.view.outline.labels.enabled

Show the labels in the outline/structure views. Reload VSCode after changing the value.

| type     | default value |
|----------|---------------|
| _boolean | `true`        |

## Counting words

To count the number of words in the current document, call _Count words in LaTeX document_ from the Command Palette (the associated command is `latex-workshop.wordcount`)

### latex-workshop.texcount.path

Define the location of TeXCount executive file/script

| type     | default value |
|----------|---------------|
| _string_ | `"texcount"`  |

This command will be joint with `latex-workshop.texcount.args` and required arguments to form a complete command of TeXCount

### latex-workshop.texcount.args

TeXCount arguments to count words in LaTeX document of the entire project from the root file, or the current document.

| type                 | default value |
|----------------------|---------------|
| _array_ of _strings_ | `[]`          |

Arguments must be in separate strings in the array. Additional arguments, i.e., `-merge %DOC%` for the project and the current document path for counting current file will be appended when constructing the command.
