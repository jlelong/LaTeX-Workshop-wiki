# Intellisense

This extension provides a variety of intellisense completions for different LaTeX features; notably for citations, labels, and file names.

## Citations

Every file of a LaTeX project is parsed to look for bibliography resources, either directly in a `thebibliography` environment or given by the `bibliography` or `addbibresource` commands or variants of them. If some of these resources are located outside the project directly, you need to list the directories where to look for them in [`latex-workshop.latex.bibDirs`](#latex-workshoplatexbibDirs). When loading the extension, the files listed in `latex-workshop.latex.additionalBib` are set up for watching if they exist and then thanks to the watching process any modification to these files are visible inside the extension. No need to restart/reload vscode.

Then, when citation commands like `\cite` and its derivatives are automatically completed with bibliography entries found in the various resources.

If you use very large bibtex files, you may experience temporary freezing. Hence, files larger than 5MB are ignored (see [`latex-workshop.intellisense.citation.maxfilesizeMB"`](#latex-workshopintellisensecitationmaxfilesizeMB)).

## References

Similarly as for the citation mechanism, all files of a LaTeX project are search for labels. Then, any `\ref` related command is automatically completed with label keys.

## Commands

The key `\` automatically triggers completion of LaTeX commands. Several mechanism play together to build the list of available commands.

- A set of standard LaTeX commands is provided.
- The files of a LaTeX project are searched for any already used commands in the form `mycommand` followed by several `{}` groups. Then, a snippet is dynamically built for each of them and they are added to command completion list.
- When [`latex-workshop​.intellisense​.package​.enabled`](#latex-workshopintellisensepackageenabled) is `true`, the command completion list is also populated with the commands provided by all the package used in the project (through `\usepackage`). The list of commands provided by every package is described [here](https://github.com/LaTeXing/LaTeX-cwl).
- The completion list can use either placeholders or tabstops. The default is to use tabstops, but it can be changed using [`latex-workshop.intellisense.useTabStops.enabled`](#latex-workshopintellisenseuseTabStopsenabled).
  - placeholders: they provide meaningful information on the arguments but prevent any autocompletion trigger.
  - tabstops: they enable us to directly trigger autocompletion again for citations and references.
- We provide one entry in the intellisense completion list per LaTeX command signature. If you feel, it makes the completion list too long, set [`latex-workshop.intellisense.optionalArgsEntries.enabled`](#latex-workshopintellisenseoptionalArgsEntries) to `false`.

## Configuration variables

### latex-workshop.intellisense.citation.label

Defines what to show as suggestion labels when intellisense provides citation suggestions.

- bibtex key: Show bibtex keys in the inline intellisense.
- title: Show publication titles in the inline intellisense.
- authors: Show publication authors in the inline intellisense.

| type     | default value  |
| -------- | -------------- |
| _string_ | `"bibtex key"` |

### latex-workshop.intellisense.citation.maxfilesizeMB

Define the maximum bibtex file size for the extension to parse in MB.

| type    | default value |
| ------- | ------------- |
| _float_ | `5`           |

### latex-workshop.intellisense.citation.type

Define which type of hint to show when intellisense provides citation suggestions.

- inline: Use the inline intellisense to provide citation completion items.
- browser: Use a dropdown menu to provide citation completion items.

| type   | default value |
| ------ | ------------- |
| string | `"inline"`    |

### latex-workshop.intellisense.package.enabled

Auto-complete commands and environments from used packages.

| type      | default value |
| --------- | ------------- |
| _boolean_ | `false`       |

### latex-workshop.intellisense.optionalArgsEntries.enabled

Many LaTeX commands can have several signatures, each with different arguments. If set to True, the intellisense completion list will have one entry for each form of a given command.

| type      | default value |
| --------- | ------------- |
| _boolean_ | `true`        |

### latex-workshop.intellisense.useTabStops.enabled

Use tabstops instead of placeholders in intellisense. Tabstops enable us to directly trigger autocompletion again (particularly useful for citations and references). On the contrary, placeholders prevent any direct call to autocompletion but they provide more information on the arguments meaning.

| type      | default value |
| --------- | ------------- |
| _boolean_ | `true`        |

Reload vscode after change.

### latex-workshop.intellisense.surroundCommand.enabled

**The use `\` to surround selected text has been deprecated and may be removed in future releases, see [there](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Snippets#surrounding-text) for the new approach.**

When `\` is typed with text selected, surround the selection with LaTeX command.

| type      | default value |
| --------- | ------------- |
| _boolean_ | `false`       |

### latex-workshop.intellisense.unimathsymbols.enabled

When `\` is typed, show unimath symbols in the dropdown selector.

| type      | default value |
| --------- | ------------- |
| _boolean_ | `false`       |

### latex-workshop.latex.additionalBib

Addition bibliography files to watch.

Both relative and absolute paths/globs are supported, but absolute ones are suggested. Relative path start from the root file location, so be ware if it is located in sub-directory.

** Deprecated in favor of [`latex-workshop.latex.bibDirs`](#latex-workshoplatexbibDirs).**

| type                 | default value |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| _array_ of _strings_ | `[]`          |

### latex-workshop.latex.bibDirs

List of directories where to look for `.bib` files.

Absolute paths are required. This setting is only used by the intellisense feature, you may also need to set the environment variable `BIBINPUTS` properly for the LaTeX compiler to find the `.bib` files.

| type                 | default value |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| _array_ of _strings_ | `[]`          |
